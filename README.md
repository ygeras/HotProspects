# HotProspects

## Project Description

The project is a part of 100 Days of SwiftUI curriculum by Paul Hudson [Hacking with swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)

The app tracks those who you meet at conferences. It will show a QR code that stores your attendee information, then others can scan that code to add you to their list of possible leads for later follow up.

## Project Requirements

Package CodeScanner is required for the app to work, and its available on GitHub under the MIT license at https://github.com/twostraws/CodeScanner. Add it to Xcode by following these steps:

- Go to File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency.
- Enter https://github.com/twostraws/CodeScanner as the package repository URL.
- For the version rules, leave “Up to Next Major” selected, which means you’ll get any bug fixes and additional features but not any breaking changes.
- Press Finish to import the finished package into your project.
